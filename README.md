# Timeless

> A minimalistic Shopify Theme built with Tailwind CSS

Inspired from the flaws (and features) of [Dawn](https://github.com/Shopify/dawn).
An iteration of my archived theme [Danshari](https://github.com/mitchuman/danshari).

## Tailwind CSS

> Configured in `snippets/tailwind.liquid`

```html
<style type="text/tailwindcss">
  /* ... */
</style>
```

To add custom CSS, use the Custom CSS editor found in the [theme editor](https://shopify.dev/docs/themes/tools/online-editor)

## Polaris Icons

> Defined in `snippets/icon.liquid`

```liquid
{% render 'icon' with 'cart' %}
```
